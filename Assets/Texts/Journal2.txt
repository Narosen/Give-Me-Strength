20 November 1977

Mike has been acting strange lately. He seems to be more efficient and smarter than he usually is. He doesn't talk much either. I bet he finally realized how dumb he had been acting all these days and is trying to fix it. Anyway, it doesn't matter as long as he doesn't get in my way. Today I'm going to go and have a check on my capsules. Tomorrow I'll be finally going back to the Main Lab.
