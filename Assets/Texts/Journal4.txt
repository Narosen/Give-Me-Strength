24 December 1977

Mike looks more and more terrible each passing day. I modified the capsules a bit and gave it to him. Hope he gets better. The original capsules were actually meant for the soldiers to accelerate their strength during war. They can take it only once a month. The modified version I gave Mike should help him to change his body's strength back to normal. I still can't believe he was stupid enough to try an unknown capsule hidden away in the store room.
