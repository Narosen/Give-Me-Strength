10 December 1978

Mike has locked me up in a room where we keep mental patients. I still don't know what he is up to. He is a threat. I have a capsule with me that I've been working on for a long time, longer than the other prototypes. It's really powerful. I hoped I'd never have to use it... I have no other choice but to take it and kill him.
