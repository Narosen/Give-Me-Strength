20 December 1977

Something terrible has happened. Half of the capsules were gone when I went to check on them! After some digging, I found out that Mike had been consuming them since last month. I've been secretly observing him. Damn it! Because of him I can't go back to the Main Lab.

He stopped taking them after I kept the capsules with me and I can see some changes in his body. This is not good. Not good at all. The capsules are not meant to be taken on a regular basis.
