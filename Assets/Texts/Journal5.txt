2 January 1978

I made a big mistake. I thought my modified capsule was working totally fine. Mike's body looks normal and he started talking. But Mike isn't Mike anymore. He is acting totally weird. He suddenly asked for my capsules. As soon as I refused, he grabbed my arm. And what extraordinary strength he had! I had no other choice but to show him where I hid it. I don't know what he is up to but surely it can't be anything good. He doesn't know much about the capsules, but I do. I need to do something before things gets worse.
