Finally my experiment is complete! I can smell money coming to me already. Before Mike finds out, I need to hide these capsules safely. He has done nothing but mistakes. He is locked in his room and it has been a couple of days now. I wonder what's he up to. No matter, that makes my job easier. I'll be here for one more month. It's better to hide the capsules in the abandoned store room. Got to find the keys.
