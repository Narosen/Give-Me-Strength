Entry 6

Found another building. It seems to be locked and I can't see any other entrance. I need to think about what to do now. I'm not doing so well as a search squad. Maybe I'm better at exploring. Maybe at finding more capsules. 
Why am I so interested in capsules? I thought my main aim was to find my Dad and Sis.
