Entry 7

I am in the middle of nowhere and I can't find ANYONE. The building right in front of me has a broken door and that's the only way that will lead me somewhere. I will give it a try. I hope my family wasn't unfortunate like me in the acident by getting lost alone in this dreaded place. I'm thankful for the capsules. I am actually interested in them now. I found some torn journal pages around. The journal belonged to a scientist that was working here. He seemed to have created the capsules. I need to know more about them. I'm going inside the building.
