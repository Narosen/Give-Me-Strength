Entry 1

This is probably the worst thing that could ever happen to me. It all went too fast... and blurry. I don't know why our car crashed. Dad is usually careful when he is driving with us. I remember seeing something at the side of the road just before the accident. Or maybe it's just in my head. I don't understand what's going on. I need to find Dad and Holly. 
I hope they are alright.
